      <p>It began, as most Ministry inquiries do, with dessert.</p>
      <p>Last Friday evening, Chuck and Nancy T.—upright Taxpayers and registered participants in the Patriot Energy Credit Program—hosted fellow Taxpayers Glenn and Marie P. for supper at their canal home. The evening was uneventful until, according to an overperforming smart speaker, the conversation strayed into restricted seasonal territory.</p>
      <p><em>Tariffs.</em></p>
      <p>“I just don’t understand,” Mrs. P. allegedly said, “why a country as blessed as ours can’t get a coffee set through customs.”</p>
      <p>The remark drew laughter, followed by a silence so dense it achieved its own gravity. Somewhere in that silence, the state began listening more closely.</p>
      <p>By dawn, the couples’ profiles appeared in the Naples Ministry of Compliance docket under Minor Concern Regarding Trade Faith. Officials insist there’s “no ongoing investigation,” though both homes have been flagged for the Courtesy Audit of Emotional Alignment, a standard year-end review of holiday tone.</p>
      <p>Neighbors describe the couples as pleasant, punctual, and “the kind of people who wipe their porch cameras before curfew.” One neighbor, speaking anonymously while polishing his flagpole, said, “If they were guilty, they’d own cats. They don’t.”</p>
      <p>Ministry officials have since clarified that tariff delays in imported giftware are a sign of “robust national virtue.” “Every detained parcel is an act of faith,” said spokesperson Hallie Dunt. “It reminds citizens that Christmas is not about getting, but about waiting obediently.”</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, screenshots of the couples’ brief social media posts—removed “for tone”—continue to circulate on Patriot Boards. Some users call for forgiveness (“They only wanted their coffee set”), while others demand example-making (“Doubt is the gateway drug to democracy”).</p>
      <p>As of this writing, no arrests have been made. The canal patrol boats drift past the T. home without slowing.</p>
      <p>But locals whisper that if the Ministry vans arrive before Christmas, it won’t be to deliver gifts.</p>
      <p><strong>They’ll just be taking back the receipt.</strong></p>
