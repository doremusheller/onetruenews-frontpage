      <p>Dear Craig and KT,</p>

      <p>I wanted to reach out to let you know about a small disruption in class today involving Finnegan. During lessons, he chose to respond to every question with what can best be described as a maniacal dog laughter noise. While undeniably inventive, it did make it a bit tricky for others to concentrate.</p>

      <p>We had a short chat about how sound effects, however impressive, aren’t always the best fit for class discussions. He was howling on all fours by the end of it.</p>

      <p>If this continues we will have to put him in a kennel in class.</p>

        Warmly,<br>
        Ms. Sniffalotoftoes
