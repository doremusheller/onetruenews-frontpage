          In a clinic polished to parade gloss, the First Citizen conducts bedside inspections,
          calibrating morale with a handshake, a grin, and a photographer who salutes without blinking.

          The Ministry Mercy Pavilion—its name tested on focus groups until it squeaked—opened two double doors at once this morning,
          and in came the traveling weather system known as the First Citizen. The air pressure adjusted. Flags straightened.
          A portable hymn of cameras rolled forward on gimbals like respectful geese.
        </p>
        <p>
          Grundy began at Bed One, where an Angel with a bandaged shoulder sat at attention, the sling saluting for him.
          “How we feeling, hero?” the First Citizen asked, voice tuned to the key of Benevolent Thunder.
          The Angel replied with the correct answer—“Better, sir”—and was awarded a handshake calibrated to the gram for headlines.
          A nurse recorded the dosage under MEDS: OPTIMISM (PATRIOT GRADE).
        </p>
        <p>
          At Bed Two a young sergeant practiced breathing through pain and protocol. Grundy leaned in like a friendly storm.
          “You took the hit so the rest of us could keep smiling without paperwork,” he said,
          inventing a doctrine on the spot. The sergeant nodded; a public information officer nodded harder;
          the cameras captured both nods and averaged them into national agreement.
        </p>

                <p>
          Between beds, the Pavilion’s walls displayed tactical art: landscapes in amber and indigo, with rivers marching in straight lines.
          A placard explained that recovery follows orders here.
          The TAFAJ Threat Meter, mounted politely near the snack station, hovered at <em>Concerned but Photogenic</em>.
          Visitors refreshed themselves with Export-Grade Optimism served in commemorative cups you can’t wash by hand.
        </p>
        <p>
          At Bed Five, where a veteran of last week’s “unfortunate stairwell event” rested, the First Citizen held a moment of silence
          long enough for the photographers to reload. “You are the proof,” Grundy pronounced finally,
          “that our angels do not fall—they simply descend for maintenance.” The line landed with surgical precision.
          A speechwriter behind him wrote it down for future history and immediate merchandise.
        </p>
        <p>
          The tour concluded at the therapy gym, where a therapist guided a corporal along a parallel bar labeled
          <strong>DIGNITY THROUGH WORK (CLINICAL EDITION)</strong>.
          Grundy tried the bar himself for three symbolic steps, then ceded the floor to the professionals,
          declaring that expertise is beautiful when it applauds correctly.
        </p>
        <p>
          Outside, a press aide distributed the official summary: <em>Visit Operational. Spirits Elevated. Nation Calibrated.</em>
          Inside, the Pavilion resumed its quieter arithmetic: breath in, breath out, again.
          The Angels returned to the patient work of knitting bones and stories; the country, to the lighter task of repeating them.
          By evening the Threat Meter ticked down one notch—not because danger retreated, but because reassurance had been televised.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the gift alcove, a small sign appeared beside the register:
          <em>Donations welcome; gratitude assumed.</em> The cashier smiled the new standard smile—four seconds, no teeth—
          and promised every purchaser a receipt that would last longer than pain.
