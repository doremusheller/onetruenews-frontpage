          **First Citizen Grundy** arrived at the Angels Military Hospital this morning
          with what aides described as “a tremendous volume of optimism.”
          Clad in his signature sequined jacket, the Citizen shook hands, signed slings,
          and distributed certified laughter units to every visible patient.
        </p>

        <p>
          Hospital officials confirmed the visit was part of the National Visibility Initiative,
          ensuring that all veterans could be seen believing in recovery.
          Cameras followed Grundy as he praised the precision of the nurses,
          the order of the bandages, and the heroic straightness of every clipboard.
        </p>

        <p>
          “These fellas are tough,” Grundy announced. “They stood up for standing up itself.”
          Observers noted that the statement, though circular, drew a standing ovation
          from those physically able to stand.
        </p>

        <p>
          The First Citizen paused frequently to salute ceiling fixtures, apparently mistaking them
          for surveillance drones, before thanking the “healing spirit of the fluorescent dawn.”
          Medical staff described the gesture as “motivational if somewhat dazzling.”
        </p>

        <p>
          When asked about the purpose of his visit, Grundy replied:
          “I just wanted to check if morale was upright, polished, and fit for public display.
          You can’t put a shine on courage if you don’t buff it once in a while.”
          The remark was entered into the National Archives under “Preventive Leadership.”
        </p>

        <p>
          Later, Grundy presented each patient with a commemorative patch reading
          <em>‘Still Standing (Mostly)’</em> and a voucher for one complimentary patriotic broadcast.
          The Ministry of Symbolism praised the move as “a balanced gesture of both recovery and recursion.”
        </p>

        <p>
          As he departed, Grundy offered a final benediction:
          “Rest easy, Angels. The nation watches, and the nation approves.”
          The room responded with coordinated nodding, and the cameras captured exactly the required number of smiles.
