          The wall is finished. In a ceremony measured by decibel, lumen, and loyalty,
          <strong>First Citizen Grundy</strong> arrived at the southern perimeter last night to observe
          the placement of the final seam—an act described by state commentators as both “masonry” and “miracle.”
        </p>

        <p>
          Broadcast coverage opened with a moment of static, followed by the national overture in subdued brass.
          The wall stretched east to west behind Grundy, an unbroken line of engineered patience.
          Floodlights turned the horizon amber, dissolving the night into orderly conclusion.
        </p>

        <p>
          “Completion is continuity,” Grundy declared, his voice echoing across the newly sealed edge.
          “We close the circle not to end, but to remain unentered.”
          The assembled engineers nodded in sync, holding clipboards printed with the Ministry of Containment’s
          motto: <em>No breach, no burden, no beyond.</em>
        </p>

        <p>
          Thousands of sanctioned citizens watched from secure zones, waving identical banners of cream and indigo.
          Officials noted that this was the first major project to achieve full attendance compliance,
          with enthusiasm verified by aerial sensors.
          “It is the people’s wall,” stated Infrastructure Spokesperson Clarion Verge.
          “They built it, they believe it, they will never have to look past it.”
        </p>

        <p>
          At the ceremony’s conclusion, a convoy of patriotic machinery rolled backward from the site,
          leaving a single worker standing alone beside the seam. His silhouette was briefly illuminated,
          then absorbed by the synchronized dimming sequence that marked the end of the broadcast.
        </p>

        <p>
          In post-event coverage, commentators speculated that the worker’s identity would be enshrined
          as “The Last Citizen Outside,” a new national archetype representing closure and vigilance.
          “He looked small,” one presenter said, “but that’s the scale of completion.”
        </p>
