        <p>With banners unfurled and clipboards raised, enumeration teams swept through the Corrected State today to verify unity totals. Officials reminded citizens that every count is a pledge, every checkbox a declaration of place and faith.</p>

        <p>Residents expressed gratitude for the opportunity to reaffirm both their residence and their belief. “Being counted makes you real,” said one loyal subject as he straightened his uniform for the fourth time that hour.</p>

        <p>Preliminary tallies suggest record levels of civic presence, though statisticians warned that numbers may continue to rise as lagging households are located and corrected. “Our goal is one hundred percent accounted — and accounted for,” explained the Minister of Metrics.</p>

        <p>Results will be archived permanently in the National Registry of Certainty. Citizens are advised to keep a copy of their enumeration receipt for spontaneous checks or inspiration.</p>
