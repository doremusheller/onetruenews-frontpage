        <p>
          State television issued a clarification following the First Citizen’s latest televised reflection,
          in which he redefined the nation’s material priorities using a word no one expected to survive censors.
        </p>

        <p>
          What began as a routine TAFAJ network reassurance broadcast turned elastic early this morning
          when <strong>First Citizen Grundy</strong> described latex not as “a supply material,”
          but as “an ideological lubricant uniting us through proper friction.”
          The statement prompted the Vigiles Communication Bureau to dispatch twenty clarification units before sunrise.
        </p>

        <p>
          “The First Citizen was speaking metaphorically, as always,” explained Deputy Minister of Explanation Clive Merge.
          “Latex is a symbol of flexibility, not an endorsement of any unsanctioned gloss.”
          Despite the official line, the quote ricocheted through newsfeeds faster than the bureau’s prepared rebuttal images.
        </p>

        <p>
          By mid-morning, patriotic factories received updated posters titled <em>Resilience, Not Lubrication</em>,
          showing Grundy’s smiling face beside a new slogan: “Stay Shiny, Stay Correct.”
          Workers reportedly applauded for exactly nine seconds, per national guidance.
        </p>

        <p>
          Meanwhile, the TAFAJ studio issued a technical apology for “microphone intimacy”
          after Grundy leaned too close to the national condenser and breathed the word “slide”
          in what one critic called “an unforgettable register of authority.”
          State engineers have since installed a Respectful Distance Indicator on all podiums.
        </p>

        <p>
          When asked later whether his phrasing was intentional,
          Grundy laughed and replied, “You folks need to lighten up; I was just sayin’ things stick better when they’re shiny.”
          The room fell briefly silent as aides conferred over whether the comment qualified as reassurance or prophecy.
        </p>

        <p>
          The Vigiles, maintaining high posture and unbroken smiles, confirmed that
          “the nation’s moral sealant remains intact and fully compliant with Directive 22-A.”
          An additional clarification film, <em>Why He Meant What You Think He Didn’t</em>,
          is scheduled to air tonight at 2000 hours.
        </p>

        <p>
          Analysts at the Ministry of Tone concluded that the broadcast
          successfully reinforced public confidence in the government’s material policies,
          even if the meaning itself “expanded beyond intended viscosity.”
          Merchants of state merchandise have already reported a surge in sales of commemorative gloves.
        </p>

        <p>
          The First Citizen closed his remarks with a familiar grin and the words,
          “Keep it smooth out there,” before waving in three directions at once.
          Cameras captured the gesture from all angles—an act later described by officials as
          “a triumphant gesture of multidirectional unity.”
