          The Corrected State erupted in applause today as <strong>First Citizen Grundy</strong> endorsed what he called “the most visionary sorting effort in modern governance”—a forthcoming <strong>Color-Coded Census</strong> intended to “brighten our data and our destiny.” No timeline, method, or meaning was provided, but officials say enthusiasm is already “measurable by tone alone.”
        </p>

        <p>
          The announcement came during a surprise noon broadcast, interrupted mid-weather to reveal Grundy standing before a rotating prism emblazoned with the words <em>KNOW THY SHADE</em>. Smiling broadly, he told viewers, “We’ve counted heads for years. It’s time to count hues.” The ticker beneath him read simply: <strong>UNITY LOOKS GOOD IN COLOR</strong>.
        </p>

        <p>
          Within minutes, ministries across the capital issued congratulatory statements praising the plan’s “clarity and style.” The <strong>Vigiles Bureau of Enumeration</strong> confirmed that “every Citizen will soon glow in alignment with their contribution,” while the <strong>Ministry of Morale</strong> described it as “a census of the soul conducted through tasteful pigmentation.”
        </p>

        <p>
          Crowds gathered spontaneously in shopping districts, holding up household objects to guess their future assignments. “I think I’m a warm amber,” said one <strong>Taxpayer</strong>, “because I pay early and believe often.” Nearby, a <strong>Citizen</strong> in work overalls shouted, “Whatever color Grundy is, I’m the next shade lighter—out of respect!” Both remarks received immediate approval from roving interview drones.
        </p>

        <p>
          Analysts at <em>One True Infotainment</em> noted a surge of patriotic euphoria rivaling last year’s Wall Completion Gala. Merchants reported shortages of red dye and mirrors. “People want to look accurate,” explained a <strong>Vigile</strong> stationed outside a cosmetics outlet. “Accuracy is loyalty made visible.”
        </p>

        <p>
          Late in the day, Grundy’s office released a single clarifying line: <em>“The census is not about who you are, but how beautifully you appear when counted.”</em> The phrase was instantly printed on banners, t-shirts, and approved window decals. The official campaign poster features the First Citizen’s silhouette against a spectrum halo, captioned: <strong>SEE YOURSELF IN THE NATION</strong>.
        </p>

        <p class="note"><em>Editor’s note: Implementation guidelines for the Color-Coded Census will follow once the appropriate color has been chosen for them.</em></p>
