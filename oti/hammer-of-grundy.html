        <p>Under a ceiling of synchronized drones and a moon timed to ministry schedule, <strong>Hammer of Grundy</strong> returned to the White House lawn for a night of approved metal anthems and calibrated fervor. The Ministry of Culture rated the performance “exemplary in volume discipline,” adding that every chorus “fell within patriotic decibel norms.”</p>

        <p>Frontman Rex Valor entered with a salute and a shoulder-mounted microphone halo, opening on the stomp of <em>Steel Beneath the Banner</em> and sliding into <em>Liberty Screams</em> amid sparks shaped like the First Citizen’s profile. Valor spoke briefly between songs: “We play so the flag doesn’t have to shout.” The crowd—wristbands blinking in ministry sync—responded with applause loops pre-cleared for rhythm cleanliness.</p>

        <p>Officials said attendance surpassed expectations while remaining “fully countable.” Security cordons formed concentric rings around the stage, each ring labeled with a virtue. Medical staff handed out ear shields printed with the slogan <em>Hear Responsibly, Believe Louder</em>. On the presidential balcony, Grundy appeared twice, offering the nod often described as “national punctuation.”</p>

        <p>Program notes, distributed digitally, described the set as “a calibrated escalation from doubt to doctrine.” The ballad <em>Forged by His Smile</em> arrived mid-show like ceremonial rest: phones lifted, screens turned to the balcony. “That chorus is designed for throat memory,” explained a Ministry musicologist, citing a study on “anthem retention and civic posture.”</p>

        <p>Sound engineers reported zero feedback except “patriotic resonance” off the north portico. A team of <em>Vibe Marshals</em>—recognizable by sashes the color of polished brass—circulated to “stabilize rapture,” encouraging hydration and synchronized waving. During the encore, the drone swarm formed a moving portrait of Grundy; the eyes brightened on cue to a chord called “Ascension Fifth.”</p>

        <p>Beyond the barricades, vendors sold commemorative picks stamped with the seal. A limited run of ear shields embossed with <strong>LOUD BUT LAWFUL</strong> sold out by the final solo. At show’s end, Valor lowered his mic like a saber and declared, “The night is patriotic.” Fireworks followed, quiet enough to be respectful, bright enough to be remembered.</p>
