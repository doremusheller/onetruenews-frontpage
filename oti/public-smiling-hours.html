      <section>
        <p>Nationwide grin initiative credited with “increased warmth and cheek resilience.” The Ministry of Wellbeing announced the official extension of Public Smiling Hours to preserve morale visibility through the darker quarter, increasing daily duration from fourteen to sixteen hours.</p>

        <p>Officials cited early studies showing “a measurable glow in national tone,” with particular improvement in regions previously labeled frown-prone. In the capital, compliance monitors reported record participation, with citizens maintaining expressions rated “warm to radiant” for most daylight hours.</p>

        <p>“We smile because we can,” said Deputy Minister Lora Henth, during a televised audit at a downtown plaza. “Cold is temporary; morale is forever.” Volunteers distributed cocoa-flavored grin wax to prevent chapping and to “keep the corners consistent.”</p>

        <p>Critics of the program were reminded that Public Smiling Hours are a civic celebration, not a mandate. “Participation remains voluntary within expected norms,” the Ministry clarified, adding that “grimacing, partial grins, or ironic smirks” may still count toward the quota if performed with sincerity.</p>

        <p>The extension, effective immediately, will remain in place through March, subject to solar review and cheek elasticity studies. Citizens are encouraged to “prepare their faces for faith-based endurance.”</p>
