      <section>
        <p>There are moments in history when Providence selects a single woman to bear the nation’s grief — and monetize it efficiently. After the tragic, unprovoked passing of <em>Rex Reece</em>, our beloved Prophet of Patriotic Truth, the Corrected States could have fallen silent. But silence, as Faithlynn reminds us nightly, is for the godless and the broke.</p>
        <p>Born Faithlynn Monroe in the humble heartland suburbs of New Dallas, she spent her early years perfecting the twin virtues of pageant poise and consumer instinct. Her beauty was her gift; her belief, a brand in waiting. When she met Rex — radiant with ratings, already four divorces deep — the chemistry was instant. <em>He saw in her a woman who could weep on cue; she saw in him a retirement plan.</em> Their love was legendary, at least on camera, where she played the part of devoted helpmeet while he thundered at invisible enemies on cable feeds.</p>
        <p>Then came the night of infamy — a “domestic infiltration event,” as the Ministry officially termed it. Evil forces conspired to silence Rex in a moment of private heroism history will never fully understand. The medical examiner’s report was misplaced during a routine data-purification process. Faithlynn received the folded flag, the primetime slot, and a lifetime contract.</p>
        <p>Today she serves as the radiant host of <em>Morning Devotion with Faithlynn</em>, where she continues Rex’s mission to protect freedom from freeloaders, foreign accents, and female independence. Each episode begins with trembling lips and a slow pan across the “Sanctuary of Rex,” his glass-encased microphone illuminated like a relic. She prays for the nation, for the faithful, and for those yet to subscribe to the Premium Tier of the Faithlynn Fellowship Network.</p>
        <p>Her tears are famous, her wardrobe inspired: glossy leather modesty in the front, moral armor in the back. She calls it “mourning chic.” The Ministry calls it “convertible.” Between devotionals she announces new products from the <em>Faithlynn Foundation for Family Integrity</em> — heirloom candles, patriotic lingerie, and the limited-edition <strong>Rexurrection Coffee</strong>, roasted to perfection in the fires of persecution.</p>
        <p>Her followers — the <em>Reecelings</em> — number in the millions. They send testimonials, donations, and occasional blood samples to be blessed by her prayer team. Analysts note that in just one fiscal quarter, Faithlynn has surpassed Rex’s lifetime fundraising totals. Her success is a comfort to the Ministry: proof that in the Corrected States, faith remains the most reliable revenue stream.</p>
        <p>Critics whisper that Faithlynn’s tears are synthetic, that her sorrow smells faintly of cashmere and capitalism. But the Ministry has reviewed the footage and found no reason to doubt her sincerity. When she raises her eyes to heaven, the metrics rise with her.</p>
        <p>Tonight on OTI Prime, Faithlynn returns with a special message: <em>“Rex may have died for truth, but I live for the truth of Rex.”</em> And the crowd will stand, as it always does, because in her voice they hear what they want most — proof that grief, properly managed, can last forever.</p>
