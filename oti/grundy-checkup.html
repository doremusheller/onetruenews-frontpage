      <p>First Citizen Galen Grundy made a “routine morale inspection” of Walter Reed National Military Medical Center this week, emerging—according to government physicians—“as fit as the Republic itself.”</p>

      <p>Dr. Lenora Flint, Senior Director of Presidential Vitalities, told <em>OTI</em> that Grundy’s “pulse thunders with patriotic vigor” and that his blood type has been “formally reclassified as Pure American Positive.” She praised his “robust constitution, radiant gums, and a metabolism that burns disloyalty like kindling.”</p>

      <p>Pressed for details, Dr. Flint dismissed rumors of “minor physiological irregularities,” then clarified: “The First Citizen’s ankle occasionally whistles when exposed to barometric pressure. His left pupil reacts exclusively to the national anthem, and he sheds a harmless but persistent cinnamon dust during televised addresses.”</p>

      <p>Asked about future appointments, Dr. Flint smiled: “Only for maintenance—he’s the healthiest man ever to require three cardiologists and a personal exorcist.”</p>
