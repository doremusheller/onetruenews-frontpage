        <h2>BREAKING BULLETIN — ONE TRUE INFOTAINMENT</h2>

        <p>At 02:14 CST, surveillance assets monitoring <strong>No Man’s Land</strong>—the restricted corridor south of the Chicago River—recorded a lone figure in violation of curfew and restricted perimeter law. The subject, identity unknown, appeared on elevated Vigiles reconnaissance feed <strong>CAM-19A</strong> before visual interference terminated transmission.</p>

        <p>The individual, now designated <strong>Subject EXT-1</strong>, is believed connected to the disappearance of three Angels patrol officers during night operations earlier this week:</p>

        <ul>
          <li><strong>Captain Elias Moore</strong> — Commanding Officer, 3rd Angel Division</li>
          <li><strong>Lieutenant Arjun Baines</strong> — Recon Operations Specialist</li>
          <li><strong>Sergeant Trevor McKee</strong> — Communications Support, 3rd Angel Division</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Contact with their unit was lost at 23:47 CST on Tuesday following a scheduled clearance sweep along the Dearborn–Madison axis. Subsequent drone surveillance recovered the officers’ abandoned vehicle and torn comms webbing approximately 400 meters inside the exclusion perimeter. No remains or signals have been recovered.</p>
