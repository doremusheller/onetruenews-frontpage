        <h2>BREAKING BULLETIN — ONE TRUE INFOTAINMENT</h2>
        <p>At 02:14 CST, surveillance assets monitoring <strong>No Man’s Land</strong>—the restricted corridor south of the Chicago River—recorded a lone figure in violation of curfew and restricted perimeter law. The subject, identity unknown, appeared on elevated Vigiles reconnaissance feed <strong>CAM-19A</strong> before visual interference terminated transmission.</p>

        <p>The individual, now designated <strong>Subject EXT-1</strong>, is believed connected to the disappearance of three Angels patrol officers during night operations earlier this week:</p>

        <ul>
          <li><strong>Captain Elias Moore</strong> — Commanding Officer, 3rd Angel Division</li>
          <li><strong>Lieutenant Arjun Baines</strong> — Recon Operations Specialist</li>
          <li><strong>Sergeant Trevor McKee</strong> — Communications Support, 3rd Angel Division</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Contact with their unit was lost at 23:47 CST on Tuesday following a scheduled clearance sweep along the Dearborn–Madison axis. Subsequent drone surveillance recovered the officers’ abandoned vehicle and torn comms webbing approximately 400 meters inside the exclusion perimeter. No remains or signals have been recovered.</p>

        <h3>OFFICIAL STATEMENT</h3>
        <blockquote>
          “We are dealing with an organized, highly trained adversary,” said <strong>Commander Helena Voss</strong>, Senior Field Director of the Angels’ Northern Command. “This individual—or cell—operates with surgical precision and deliberate provocation. The disappearance of our officers is an act of terror, and we will respond in kind. Citizens should understand: the Angels do not lose people without consequence. We will find who did this. We will bring them home.”
        </blockquote>

        <p>Commander Voss confirmed that all Angels and Vigiles operating within the Chicago Security Zone have been elevated to <strong>Condition Red</strong> and instructed to “engage any hostile silhouette south of the wall without hesitation.”</p>

        <h3>PUBLIC ADVISORY</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Do <strong>not</strong> approach or contact unidentified individuals beyond sanctioned checkpoints.</li>
          <li>Do <strong>not</strong> share or distribute unverified footage of Subject EXT-1.</li>
          <li>All <strong>citizens and Taxpayers</strong> are urged to submit verified information, sightings, or tips via <strong>Ministry line 77-444-EXT</strong> or through the official <strong>One True App</strong>.</li>
          <li>Anonymous submissions will be processed but may delay response time.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>The Ministry has authorized a <strong>reward of 50,000 National Credits</strong> for information leading directly to the identification or neutralization of Subject EXT-1.</p>

        <p><em>End of Bulletin. Stay loyal. Stay certain.</em></p>
