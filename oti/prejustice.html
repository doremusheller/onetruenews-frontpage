        <p><strong>NEW CHICAGO</strong> — In a decisive overnight operation that experts are already calling <em>“inevitable,”</em> Angels units across three districts successfully prevented dozens of crimes that had not yet occurred — and, according to officials, were already becoming a problem.</p>

        <p>Using advanced behavioral modeling, facial tension analysis, and what one commander described as <em>“a gut refined by decades of patriotism,”</em> Angels detained 47 individuals flagged for <strong>Pre-Incident Hostility Potential (PIHP)</strong>. No charges were filed. None were necessary.</p>

        <p>“People get very hung up on timing,” said retired Angel Colonel Buck Slattery, now a senior fellow at the Liberty Tomorrow Institute. “They ask, ‘What did these people do?’ That’s the wrong question. The right question is: <em>What would they have done if we’d been polite about it?</em>”</p>

        <p>According to internal Ministry sources, indicators included loitering with intent, standing incorrectly, suspicious silence, and in one case, <em>“a look that suggested future noncompliance.”</em> Authorities stress that all actions were taken strictly within the bounds of the law, which has recently been streamlined to reduce hesitation.</p>

        <p>Critics on banned platforms have attempted to label the operation “authoritarian.” Officials rejected the claim.</p>

        <p>“Authoritarianism is reactive,” Slattery continued. “This was proactive. We didn’t wait for windows to break, fires to start, or feelings to get hurt. We acted at the idea stage. That’s efficiency.”</p>

        <p>Residents in affected areas reported a noticeable sense of calm the following morning. Streets were quiet. Conversations were shorter. Eye contact dropped by nearly 60 percent — a figure experts say correlates strongly with public safety.</p>

        <p>“Some people call it fear,” said one Ministry analyst. “We call it respect for outcomes.”</p>

        <p>Officials confirmed that additional Preemptive Justice operations are planned in the coming weeks, particularly in zones where citizens continue to believe that innocence is something you <em>prove after the fact.</em></p>

        <p>“In a complex world,” Slattery concluded, “waiting for crime is the real danger.”</p>

        <p>And thanks to the Angels, waiting is no longer required.</p>
