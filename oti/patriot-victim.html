      <section>
        <p>The Ministry’s chief steward of moral hygiene, <strong>Minister Martin Keel</strong>, today condemned what he called “the week’s latest episode of organized trembling,” after mainstream outlets erupted over <strong>Rance Gully’s</strong> now-legendary appearance on <em>The Remmick Hour</em>.</p>

        <p>Gully, 28 — heir to the Gully Feed &amp; Finance fortune and host of <em>Raw &amp; Righteous Live</em> — spent the broadcast trading witticisms with podcaster <strong>Tad Remmick</strong>, who introduced him as “a truth-teller with a tanning bed of courage.” Within minutes, Gully had declared that <em>“empathy is a socialist parasite,”</em> that <em>“some demographics are proof God has a sense of humor,”</em> and that <em>“the Founding Fathers would have muted half this country by now.”</em></p>

        <p>To detractors, the tirade was a hate-speech highlight reel. To Keel, it was “heartland poetry.”</p>

        <blockquote>
          <p>“Every prophet sounds crazy to the deaf,” he told OTI. “Brother Gully’s language is unvarnished lumber. It may splinter, but it still builds.”</p>
        </blockquote>

        <p>Pressed to clarify, Keel translated each remark with serene precision.</p>

        <p>When Gully dismissed empathy as disease, Keel explained, “He was referring, of course, to the spread of secular weakness masquerading as compassion.” When Gully mused about “evolution’s unfinished drafts,” Keel called it “a metaphor for moral fitness.” And when Gully said the Founders would unfollow half the nation, Keel smiled: “A plea for digital discernment. The boy understands boundaries.”</p>

        <p>Keel accused reporters of “quote taxidermy — stuffing living speech and mounting it in outrage museums.” He urged citizens to “resist the algorithm of offense” and instead “honor the courage to be misunderstood.”</p>

        <p>By evening, One True Social overflowed with applause. A verified Taxpayer named <em>CousinPatriot77</em> summarized the mood:</p>

        <blockquote>
          <p>“Finally, a young man unafraid to say what I’m too scared to think out loud. That’s the kind of honesty this country was founded to imagine.”</p>
        </blockquote>
