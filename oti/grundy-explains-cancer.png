        <p>Grundy returned to prime time tonight with a sermon he called “nutritional patriotism.” Holding a familiar crinkly bag to the camera, he declared that Funyons “scrub the colon like tiny golden lifeguards” and should be considered “the crunchy shield of the Republic.”</p>

        <p>“Listen: fiber is a vibe,” he said, gesturing broadly as the studio lights caught his sequined lapels. “If it crunches, it cleans. If it cleans, it cures. That’s how the body works when you believe in it.” He invited viewers to join him in a “daily handful of hope,” demonstrating a method he termed the “Civic Chew.”</p>

        <p>Producers displayed a graphic labeled <strong>GRUNDY EXPLAINS STUFF: FUNYONS VS. FEAR</strong>, featuring arrows, stars, and the word <em>SCIENCE</em> in patriotic script. The First Citizen tapped the screen with a pointer and announced, “There’s your data.”</p>

        <p>Reached for comment, a panel of experts described the claim as “unsupported,” “not how digestion works,” and “a commercial with extra steps.” Grundy welcomed the pushback. “Debate is healthy,” he said. “But so are these rings.” He then crunched into the mic for emphasis.</p>

        <p>Viewers wrote in with testimonials ranging from “inspirational” to “I laughed, then bought a bag.” A spokesperson for the Onion Ring Community Partnership said they were “deeply moved by the First Citizen’s faith in snacks,” adding that “belief is the nation’s most underutilized nutrient.”</p>

        <p><em>Editor’s Note:</em> Medical professionals advise that cancer prevention involves evidence-based screening and care. The First Citizen’s remarks reflect the stylistic goals of his cultural series and should not be taken as medical advice.</p>
