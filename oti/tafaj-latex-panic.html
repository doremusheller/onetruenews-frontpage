      <section class="story-body">
        <p>The Ministry of Assurance confirmed today that <strong>Vigiles have doubled their patrol routes</strong> after last night’s <em>TAFAJ</em> broadcast—a live interruption during OTI’s devotional hour that featured unidentified performers in latex attire reciting a banned nursery rhyme backward.</p>

        <p>Within minutes, the nation’s comfort index fell nine points. Hospitals reported mass fainting among viewers who misinterpreted the performance as a foreign invasion or a new brand rollout.</p>

        <blockquote>“These agitators have weaponized mischief,” declared First Citizen Grundy. “Latex is not comedy—it is an ideological lubricant, and the state will not slip.”</blockquote>

        <p>The TAFAJ transmission, lasting precisely three minutes and forty seconds, aired from an undisclosed location featuring a figure costumed as an “administrative Satan” lounging on a stone lectern. Investigators later determined the altar was actually a municipal stage prop on loan from the Ministry of Tourism.</p>

        <p>Despite exhaustive sweeps, no cell, manifesto, or corporeal TAFAJ member has been found. Officials now classify the group as a <em>“persistent concept”</em> rather than an organization—difficult to arrest, yet easy to condemn.</p>

        <p>To reassure the public, OTI launched continuous “Faith Flash Updates” showing Vigiles marching two abreast through every major district. Citizen reports of “menacing reflections” and “rubbery silhouettes” have surged but remain unverified.</p>

        <p>“We’ve entered the era of invisible rebellion,” said Security Analyst Vann Parble. “The enemy exists mainly in our conviction to spot them.”</p>

        <p>In a closing broadcast, Grundy addressed the nation directly, seated beneath immaculate lighting. He assured citizens that <strong>freedom of thought remains permitted</strong>—provided it is expressed <em>without material or rhythm.</em></p>

        <p>As cameras panned out, technicians confirmed no unauthorized elasticity within the frame.</p>
