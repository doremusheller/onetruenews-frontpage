      <section>
        <p>The First Citizen today extended “a heartfelt microfiber of compassion” to the people of Jamaica as a Category Five hurricane erased the horizon and then began working on everything else. Entire towns are without power, water, and roofs—but, according to the Office of Narrative Stability, “they are rich in character, and that’s what really matters.”</p>

        <p>In a televised address, Grundy stood before a wind machine and a borrowed reggae band, announcing that the Corrected State was “rushing symbolic aid.” Cargo planes, he said, would carry “hope, inspirational quotes, and possibly sunscreen, depending on customs.”</p>

        <p>Pressed on material support, the First Citizen clarified: <em>“Our towels are very absorbent. We’ll dry their tears and teach self-reliance at the same time.”</em></p>

        <p>Meanwhile, contractors have been instructed to repaint disaster shelters in “cheerful amber tones” to “enhance post-storm patriotism.” A leaked memo suggests funds originally allocated for food shipments were redirected to a Feel-Good Weather Initiative featuring commemorative mugs: <em>I Survived Global Freedom Season</em>.</p>

        <p>As Kingston drowns, the Ministry of Optics reclassified satellite imagery as “negative depiction of meteorology.” Domestic anchors describe the catastrophe as a “temporary Caribbean water feature” and hail Grundy’s response as “efficient, empathetic, and tax-deductible.”</p>

        <p>In closing, the First Citizen urged Jamaicans to “look on the bright side—clouds mean shade,” before boarding his helicopter to tour new “resilience workshops” from a safe altitude.</p>

        <p class="note" style="margin-top:1.25rem">When the sea takes everything, the powerful send towels—still wrapped in their price tags.</p>
