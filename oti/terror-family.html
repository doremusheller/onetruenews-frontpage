      <section>
        <p>The Ministry of Order confirmed late Tuesday that three individuals detained during an Angel relocation in the West District have been charged with multiple felonies under the <strong>Public Felicity and Conduct Act.</strong></p>

        <p>Authorities identified the suspects as an immigrant family of three—father <strong>Varek Noan</strong>, mother <strong>Tara Noan</strong>, and their six-year-old daughter—accused of “emotional disturbance and verbal incitement” during a government-supervised eviction.</p>

        <p>According to the official report, Angel units were executing a routine clearance of municipal housing designated for the <strong>Regional Academy of Optimism</strong> when the father began shouting. The broadcast drones recorded him saying, <em>“You can’t take our home and call it mercy.”</em></p>

        <p>The Ministry of Tone classified the statement as a “rhetorical assault” and triggered a localized <strong>Felicity Breach Alert.</strong></p>

        <p>“His tone registered in the red,” said Angel Supervisor <strong>Brinn Kale.</strong> “Verbal aggression at that level can lower civic morale in seconds. The Angels acted quickly to contain the spread.”</p>

        <p>Witnesses described the scene as “confused but orderly.” The mother reportedly attempted to calm her husband while holding the child, who, according to field notes, “failed to participate in the standard applause sequence.” Vigiles officers cited the lapse as “possible willful disengagement.”</p>

        <p>The family was detained on-site without resistance. Their current status is undisclosed. The Bureau of Contained Expression said all three are undergoing “affective review and recalibration.”</p>

        <p>The Ministry of Optics later released a statement calling the father’s remarks “a clear attempt to destabilize communal sentiment.”</p>

        <p>“Unhappiness spreads faster than rumor,” said spokesperson <strong>Clarion Verge.</strong> “This case demonstrates that tone is not a private matter—it’s a national resource.”</p>

        <p>Under the Felicity Act, citizens must maintain “visible gratitude” during any official encounter. Failure to do so, or the expression of “contradictory emotional output,” is punishable by reeducation or permanent civility restriction.</p>

        <p>Neighbors told OTI the family had “kept to themselves” and “never joined the Gratitude Parades.” One resident said she had “suspected a mood problem for months.”</p>

        <p>Construction crews began work early this morning to prepare the vacated apartment for its new role as part of the <strong>Happiness Reconstruction Zone</strong>, which will include murals and an interactive “Smile to Heal” display.</p>

        <p>The Bureau of Public Affect praised the Angels for “neutralizing a potential mood contagion” before it could influence nearby districts.</p>

        <p>“The public needs to understand that dissent isn’t just speech—it’s atmosphere,” said <strong>Dr. Sol Edden</strong>, Bureau Director. “We can’t let negativity linger. It’s a safety issue.”</p>

        <p>In an evening broadcast, state anchor <strong>Lira Dent</strong> summarized the Ministry’s position: “The family may have lost their apartment, but the nation gained stability.”</p>

        <p>The case remains under review.</p>
