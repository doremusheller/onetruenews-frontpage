        <p>
          The First Citizen questions the moral geometry of televised charity,
          insisting that no one should “collect animal leftovers without a proper license.”

        <p>
          During an unscheduled press encounter outside the Ministry of Cheer, 
          <strong>First Citizen Grundy</strong> turned an innocent question about national entertainment 
          into what aides later called “a unique moment of interpretive leadership.” 
          Asked if he supported the annual <em>Charity of Control</em> pet awareness telethon,
          Grundy blinked twice and declared, “I got doubts about that fella with the prizes.”
        </p>

        <p>
          Reporters quickly realized he was referring to <strong>Host Marvin Lilt</strong>, 
          the long-running presenter of the quiz program <em>Deal of the Species</em>,
          known for advocating responsible pet sterilization. Grundy continued: 
          “He says he’s fixin’ the pets, but I think he’s keepin’ all the little animal pieces! 
          That’s what he’s doin’. You can’t fool me; I watch the show!”
        </p>

        <p>
          The comment sent aides scrambling for explanations. One official attempted to clarify 
          that “the Host’s campaign promotes public health, not souvenir collection,” 
          while another suggested that Grundy had “confused metaphorical cutting with actual cutting.” 
          The First Citizen, however, doubled down. “I don’t like his grin,” he said. 
          “Looks like he’s hidin’ something furry in them pockets. Whole pockets full of critter parts, probably.”
        </p>

        <p>
          Viewers of the broadcast described Grundy’s tone as “both accusatory and weirdly proud.” 
          His remarks soon trended on national media, where supporters praised his “courage to suspect things loudly,” 
          while critics urged the Ministry of Accuracy to remind him how biology works. 
          The Ministry replied that “facts are being reviewed for patriotic phrasing.”
        </p>

        <p>
          Lilt’s production company released a polite statement noting that 
          “no fragments of animals have ever been retained by anyone affiliated with the show” 
          and invited the First Citizen to visit the set “once confusion subsides.” 
          Grundy’s office responded that he “may or may not” appear, depending on “whether the smell clears.”
        </p>

        <p>
          Later that evening, Grundy returned to national television to “clarify” his earlier remarks. 
          Holding a small dog for emphasis, he announced: 
          “I like animals. They bark when they’re supposed to. 
          I’m just sayin’ I got my eye on that quiz guy. He talks too fast, 
          like a person who’s hidin’ scissors.” 
          The dog, identified by handlers as a prop named Justice, remained calm throughout.
        </p>

        <p>
          The segment ended with the usual patriotic overture. 
          Analysts expect Grundy’s comments will inspire a new wave of merchandise, 
          including plush dogs labeled <em>“Pre-Corrected”</em> and a board game called 
          <em>Guess What He Meant!</em> 
          The Ministry of Broadcasts has confirmed reruns of the incident “for national reflection.”
        </p>

        <p>
          Asked if he regretted the misunderstanding, Grundy laughed. 
          “No regrets,” he said. “If you don’t question your game shows, you don’t love your country. 
          Now where’s that little dog’s microphone?”
