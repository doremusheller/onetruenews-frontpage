        <p>
          Outside the <strong>Ministry of Cheer</strong> this afternoon, the First Citizen paused a routine morale walk to deliver what officials later described as “a spontaneous address on the ethics of televised compassion.” Reporters had asked about a popular game-show host’s national spay-and-neuter campaign. The question, witnesses say, was “regrettably answered.”
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>“Nobody asks what happens to the pieces!”</strong> Grundy declared, raising a finger for emphasis. He explained that while “surgical modesty may sound merciful,” it often masks “the gathering of unpatriotic materials.” He warned that the host in question was “stockpiling parts for nefarious puppet work” and urged citizens to “follow the meat, not the message.”
        </p>

        <p>
          Aides attempted to redirect the conversation toward the upcoming Charity Ball for Defensible Causes, but Grundy pressed on, citing “unnamed veterinary insiders” who had allegedly traced the remains to “foreign sculpture concerns.” He called for a <em>Morality Audit</em> of all televised donations. “Some gifts,” he said, “are boomerangs with fur.”
        </p>

        <p>
          Crowds along the boulevard clapped politely while the <strong>Vigiles</strong> adjusted their microphones. One <strong>Angel</strong> from the Ministry’s media bureau assured viewers that the First Citizen’s comments were “symbolic in nature” and that “all animal leftovers remain securely within the homeland.” The bureau later issued a poster reading <em>Every Tail Has Two Ends — Know Yours.</em>
        </p>

        <p>
          By evening, the accused host released a 14-second statement thanking Grundy for “his passionate commitment to hygiene.” The statement was immediately rebroadcast as a pledge of allegiance. Markets opened the next day to a surge in pet insurance futures and a brief shortage of rubber gloves.
        </p>
