        <p>Grundy believes the game-show host who urged the nation to spay and neuter its pets may have been “saving the parts.” He says this without irony, beside a table of labeled jars purchased “for demonstration.”</p>
        <p>“You tell people to do something for years,” Grundy added, “and sooner or later, you start wondering what it looks like.” Viewers were assured no actual remains were used—though he admitted he “hadn’t checked everything.”</p>
        <p>According to Grundy, the “collection” honored patriotic science—“recycling the nation’s love.” Asked what that meant, he replied, “It means I’m explaining it.”</p>
        <p>Experts could not verify the premise. One called it “confused but enthusiastic.” Another praised Grundy’s presentation as “larger than the facts.”</p>
