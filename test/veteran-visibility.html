        <p>In what OTI anchors described as <em>“a breathtaking performance of empathy and lighting control,”</em> First Citizen Grundy concluded his <strong>Veteran Visibility Tour</strong> with a stop at the National Valor Recovery Center, where recovering Angels are undergoing restorative correction following recent exercises.</p>

        <p>The visit opened to sustained applause — a sound the First Citizen immediately joined, assuming it was for him. Addressing the crowd from behind an IV stand, he declared the ward “an unbroken front line of faith,” before praising the “polished surgical floors that mirror our collective soul.”</p>

        <p>At one point, he congratulated a maintenance worker for “bravery in lubrication” and mistook a prosthetics demonstration for an art exhibit. <em>“Nothing says recovery like getting up, even when you can’t,”</em> he remarked, a line OTI promptly elevated to slogan status during their morning recap segment.</p>

        <p>Outside, supporters waved miniature Angels helmets distributed by the Ministry of Valor Branding. Several patients attempted to salute but were hindered by recent surgery — a moment later edited into <em>“synchronized gratitude footage”</em> for the evening re-broadcast.</p>

        <blockquote>“It’s not what he says — it’s how the lighting forgives him,” one commentator concluded, as OTI looped applause under the closing credits.</blockquote>
