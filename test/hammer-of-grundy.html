        <p>The national capital trembled with rhythmic fervor last evening as the beloved patriotic metal band <strong>Hammer of Grundy</strong> performed live on the White House lawn. The Ministry of Culture hailed the event as “a triumph of sonic loyalty” and confirmed that the performance reached “legally safe but spiritually shattering” decibel levels.</p>

        <p>Frontman <strong>Rex Valor</strong>, resplendent in red-white-blue leather and a tactical halo headset, opened the show by saluting the crowd with his microphone like a saber. “We play,” he announced, “so the flag doesn’t have to shout.”</p>

        <p>The setlist included crowd favorites such as <em>“Steel Beneath the Banner,” “Liberty Screams,”</em> and the rousing ballad <em>“Forged by His Smile.”</em> Each chorus was punctuated by bursts of confetti and fireworks shaped like Administrator Grundy’s silhouette, prompting synchronized tears from the audience.</p>

        <blockquote>“When the bass drops,” one official attendee observed, “you can feel patriotism enter your bloodstream.”</blockquote>

        <p>Security reports indicate that several attendees attempted to pledge allegiance mid-guitar solo, leading to spontaneous bursts of group kneeling approved by on-site coordinators. Following Ministry tradition, ear protection devices were distributed emblazoned with the slogan <em>“Hear Responsibly, Believe Louder.”</em></p>

        <p>The night closed with a coordinated display of drone lights forming Grundy’s likeness above the stage, eyes glowing serenely. The Administrator himself appeared briefly on the palace balcony, giving a single approving nod — met with roars measurable from orbit.</p>

        <p>Plans are already underway for a spring encore titled <strong>“Feedback of Faith.”</strong> Ticket registration opens next week exclusively through the Ministry of Attendance.</p>
