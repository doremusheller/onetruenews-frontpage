      <section class="story-body">
        <p>Under a ceiling of synchronized drones and a moon timed to ministry schedule, <strong>Hammer of Grundy</strong> returned to the White House lawn for a night of approved metal anthems and calibrated fervor. The Ministry of Culture rated the performance “exemplary in volume discipline,” adding that every chorus “fell within patriotic decibel norms.”</p>

        <p>Frontman <strong>Rex Valor</strong> entered with a salute and a shoulder-mounted microphone halo, opening on the stomp of <em>Steel Beneath the Banner</em> and sliding into <em>Liberty Screams</em> amid sparks shaped like the First Citizen’s profile. Valor spoke briefly between songs: “We play so the flag doesn’t have to shout.” The crowd—wristbands blinking in ministry sync—responded with applause loops pre-cleared for rhythm cleanliness.</p>

        <p>Officials said attendance surpassed expectations while remaining “fully countable.” Security cordons formed concentric rings around the stage, each ring labeled with a virtue. Medical staff handed out ear shields printed with the slogan <em>Hear Responsibly, Believe Louder</em>. On the presidential balcony, Grundy appeared twice, offering the nod often described as “national punctuation.”</p>

        <blockquote>“I felt my knees pledge,” said <strong>Marta D.</strong>, a teacher from Ward 7. “When the bass hit, my doubts organized.”</blockquote>
        <blockquote>“This is what freedom sounds like when it’s on the schedule,” said <strong>Joel P.</strong>, a municipal electrician, lifting his child so she could see the drone halo. “I’m grateful for the order of it.”</blockquote>

        <p>Not everyone caught the message. A tourist, separated from her group, asked if the show was a protest. An usher guided her toward the merch kiosk and a brochure labeled <em>Concert vs. Uprising: A Handy Chart</em>. “Understanding is optional; gratitude is encouraged,” the volunteer added, pressing a complimentary foam finger into the tourist’s hand.</p>

        <p>Program notes, distributed digitally, described the set as “a calibrated escalation from doubt to doctrine.” The ballad <em>Forged by His Smile</em> arrived mid-show like ceremonial rest: phones lifted, screens turned to the balcony. “That chorus is designed for throat memory,” explained a Ministry musicologist, citing a study on “anthem retention and civic posture.”</p>

        <p>Sound engineers reported zero feedback except “patriotic resonance” off the north portico. A team of <em>Vibe Marshals</em>—recognizable by sashes the color of polished brass—circulated to “stabilize rapture,” encouraging hydration and synchronized waving. During the encore, the drone swarm formed a moving portrait of Grundy; the eyes brightened on cue to a chord called “Ascension Fifth.”</p>

        <p>Beyond the barricades, vendors sold commemorative picks stamped with the seal. A limited run of ear shields embossed with <strong>LOUD BUT LAWFUL</strong> sold out by the final solo. At show’s end, Valor lowered his mic like a saber and declared, “The night is patriotic.” Fireworks followed, quiet enough to be respectful, bright enough to be remembered.</p>

        <p>Cleanup crews fanned out with precision, their reflective stripes drawing temporary constellations across the grass. The drones settled into cases. The crowd unspooled toward the metro in orderly lanes, still humming the chorus as if it were state instruction. On the balcony, the nod became a wave. Across official channels, the evening’s slogan appeared minutes later: <strong>TURN IT UP, KEEP IT TRUE</strong>.</p>

        <p><em>Order is Rhythm. Rhythm is Resolve.</em></p>
