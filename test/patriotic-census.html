      <section class="story-body">
        <p>The Ministry of Civic Accounting unveiled this year’s <strong>Patriotic Census</strong>, a nationwide campaign designed to measure “the population’s unwavering enthusiasm.” Officials describe the count as a “celebration of data, devotion, and demographic unity.”</p>

        <p>Households will receive forms requesting names, ages, and “frequency of gratitude expression.” Optional sections include hymn preference, flag orientation habits, and approximate smile duration during the Anthem.</p>

        <p>At a launch ceremony broadcast live, First Citizen Grundy stood before a mountain of clipboards and declared, “Every signature is a song of faith. Every checkbox is a heartbeat for the Republic.” The crowd responded with timed applause supervised by the Bureau of Cadence.</p>

        <p>Local administrators have been instructed to assist residents who “fail to appear sufficiently tallied.” Volunteers known as Enumerators of Faith will conduct door-to-door visits, offering assistance, encouragement, and, if needed, correctional enthusiasm.</p>

        <blockquote>“It’s not surveillance,” one Ministry spokesperson clarified. “It’s closeness at scale.”</blockquote>

        <p>The campaign concludes next month with a televised awards gala, where the region displaying the “densest density of devotion” will receive a ceremonial calculator signed by the First Citizen himself.</p>
