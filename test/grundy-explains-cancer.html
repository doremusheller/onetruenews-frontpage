        <p>The First Citizen returned this week for another installment of his cultural broadcast <strong>“Grundy Explains Stuff.”</strong> The topic: cancer, and how to “snack your way to spiritual health.”</p>

        <p>Gesturing to a pyramid of Funyons behind him, Grundy declared that the onion-flavored rings “scrub the inner lining of the nation,” and that citizens should “trust the crunch.” The studio audience cheered obediently as he produced an x-ray labeled “before belief” and another marked “after snacks.”</p>

        <p>“They told me prevention was science,” Grundy said, adjusting his tie. “Turns out, it was seasoning.” He went on to explain that the product’s circular shape mirrors “the cycle of patriotic renewal,” a design he called “nutritionally spiritual.”</p>

        <p>When asked about medical consensus, he replied, “Consensus is what you get when you lose conviction.” The Ministry of Health later confirmed that Funyons remain “technically edible” and “symbolically nutritious.”</p>

        <blockquote>“The First Citizen’s diet is classified as both experimental and contagious,” noted one official observer, smiling for the camera.</blockquote>

        <p>By broadcast’s end, shelves nationwide were cleared of the snack. The program concluded with Grundy biting into a ring, nodding solemnly, and announcing next week’s episode: <em>“How Light Bulbs Feel Pain.”</em></p>
