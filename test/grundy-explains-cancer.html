        <p>On this week’s <strong>“Grundy Explains Stuff”</strong>, Administrator Grundy unveiled what he called “the roundest breakthrough in nutritional patriotism”: the claim that <strong>Funyons prevent colon cancer.</strong></p>

        <p>“These are America’s rings of health,” Grundy declared, brandishing a family-sized bag before a live studio audience. “We used to eat them for fun. Now we eat them for freedom.”</p>

        <p>He presented a self-drawn chart showing “zero cancer incidents among test subjects with the courage to believe.” The chart, produced on poster board with glitter glue, was met with applause and two standing ovations.</p>

        <p>Medical professionals contacted by the Ministry of Truth in Medicine declined to confirm or deny the claim, citing “data insufficiency and confusion about what a Funyon is.” Grundy dismissed their hesitation as “textbook cowardice.”</p>

        <blockquote>“If the science won’t support the snack,” he concluded, “the snack will support the science.”</blockquote>

        <p>Viewers flooded the ministry hotline seeking dosage guidance. Grundy responded live, recommending “at least a handful a day, more during sweeps week.”</p>

        <p>The Ministry of Nutrition Compliance has since announced plans for a pilot study titled <em>Operation Crunch Shield</em>, aimed at verifying whether “belief amplifies absorption.”</p>
