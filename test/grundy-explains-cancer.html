        <p>Grundy returned to prime time with a sermon he called “nutritional patriotism.” Holding a crinkly bag to the camera, he declared that Funyons “scrub the colon like tiny golden lifeguards,” the snack now “the crunchy shield of the Republic.”</p>
        <p>“Listen: fiber is a vibe,” he said, as the studio lights kissed his sequined lapels. “If it crunches, it cleans. If it cleans, it cures.” He invited viewers to try the “Civic Chew,” a daily handful performed with devotion and eye contact.</p>
        <p>A graphic appeared: <strong>GRUNDY EXPLAINS STUFF: FUNYONS VS. FEAR</strong>—arrows, stars, and the word <em>SCIENCE</em> in heroic script. “There’s your data,” the First Citizen said, tapping the screen with a pointer.</p>
        <p>Experts we reached called the claim “unsupported” and “not how digestion works.” Grundy welcomed the pushback. “Debate is healthy,” he said, taking a mic-crunch for emphasis. Viewers wrote in: “inspirational,” “unconventional,” and “heading to the store.”</p>
        <p><em>Editor’s Note:</em> Medical guidance should come from evidence-based screening and care. The First Citizen’s remarks reflect the stylistic goals of his cultural series.</p>
