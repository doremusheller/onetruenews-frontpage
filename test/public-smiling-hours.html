      <section class="story-body">
        <p>Citizens across the Corrected States brightened their faces and tightened their resolve as the Ministry of Wellbeing announced an official extension of <strong>Public Smiling Hours</strong> “to preserve morale visibility through the darker quarter.” The order, read aloud at 06:00 sharp from every civic loudspeaker, increases mandatory smiling duration from fourteen to sixteen hours daily and encourages “preemptive facial radiance” during commutes.</p>

        <p>At the capital square, hundreds assembled for the first expanded <em>Standardized Expression Routine</em>, colloquially known as “face-ups.” As dawn broke, Administrator Grundy’s recorded voice led citizens through synchronized grins: “Lift those corners! A nation that smiles together survives together!” By the second hour, the plaza gleamed like a human sunrise.</p>

        <p>Deputy Minister of Wellness <strong>Darla Keen</strong> hailed the response as “a triumph of spirit elasticity.” “We measure happiness in lumen now,” she said, demonstrating a <em>Smile Intensity Meter</em>—a small handheld gauge that hums softly when optimism reaches state-approved levels. Citizens scoring below threshold will receive complimentary retraining in <em>Expressive Clarity</em>.</p>

        <p>Most welcomed the change. “I used to smile on my own time,” said butcher <strong>Ron Malvey</strong>, grinning as a Ministry monitor passed. “Now it’s good to know everyone else is too. You don’t feel alone when the whole block’s teeth are out.” Schoolchildren interviewed at the plaza said they appreciated “the extra homework in joy.”</p>

        <p>Yet not all faces stayed aligned. Outside a metro kiosk, one woman, declining to give her name, asked reporters, “If it’s happiness, why does it hurt?” Authorities later described her as “temporarily expression-averse” and enrolled her in <em>Restorative Cheer Maintenance</em>. By afternoon, the Ministry confirmed she had “regained her radiance.”</p>

        <p>Newly installed <strong>Smile Monitors</strong> along major boulevards project encouragements such as “You’re Doing Fine, Citizen!” and “Every Grin Counts Toward the Gross National Cheer Index.” Several commuters paused beneath them for selfies, while others practiced “cheek pacing” to avoid cramping. A volunteer medic described the first wave of jaw fatigue as “a healthy sign of national engagement.”</p>

        <p>As evening descended, official inspectors began the first <em>Nighttime Audit of Cheerfulness</em>. Families leaned from balconies, holding smiles beneath blue verification beams. A coordinated chorus of affirmations echoed through residential blocks. “We can see the warmth from orbit,” proclaimed a Ministry communiqué, attaching thermal satellite imagery captioned <em>‘Faith Emits Heat.’</em></p>

        <p>When asked whether the extended hours might continue past spring, Grundy smiled on the national feed, cheeks shining like burnished fruit. “Happiness is renewable,” he said. “And so are we.” The next morning, Ministry billboards unveiled the new slogan: <strong>“Grin. Don’t Let Go.”</strong></p>

        <p>By night’s end, officials reported a measurable 18 percent uptick in “civic luminescence,” noting that facial brightness levels now exceed those of  pre-correction holidays. “The light,” said Deputy Keen, “comes from the people — with minimal guidance.”</p>
