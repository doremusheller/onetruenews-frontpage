      <section class="story-body">
        <p>Citizens across the Corrected States greeted today’s announcement with radiant enthusiasm as the Ministry of Wellbeing confirmed an extension of <strong>Public Smiling Hours</strong> “to preserve emotional brightness through the dim months ahead.”</p>

        <p>Effective immediately, the smiling period now runs from <strong>06:00 to 22:00</strong>, with voluntary early grins encouraged during predawn commutes. Officials hailed the change as “a low-cost investment in morale visibility,” and assured the public that <strong>facial positivity meters</strong> will be recalibrated to “reward sincerity above wattage.”</p>

        <p>At dawn, the capital’s main squares filled with rows of residents performing the <em>Standardized Expression Routine</em>, the rhythmic exercise known informally as “face-ups.” A recording of Administrator Grundy’s voice echoed across civic loudspeakers:</p>

        <blockquote>“A nation that smiles together — thrives together. Grin for growth!”</blockquote>

        <p>The Ministry’s Deputy Secretary, responding to concerns about jaw fatigue, praised citizens’ “adaptive cheek resilience.” New <em>Relaxation Intermission</em> booths will appear in select districts to provide brief, government-approved rest breaks.</p>

        <p>Evening brought the first official <strong>Smile Audit</strong>, with inspectors walking block to block, checking compliance against cheerful benchmarks. From windows above, families leaned outward in perfect alignment, faces glowing beneath bluish inspection lamps. “It feels good to be noticed,” said one resident, beaming dutifully.</p>

        <p>The Ministry projects a <strong>12 percent increase in ambient happiness</strong> and expects “seasonally adjusted joy” to remain steady through spring.</p>
