        <h2>Grundy Explains: The Collection</h2>
        <div class="meta">Investigation • Entertainment Division Archives</div>
        <p><strong>OTI Desk —</strong> In a broadcast delivered with his customary reverence, Grundy examined a long-running daytime refrain: the game show host who urged a nation to spay and neuter. What sounded like civic hygiene, Grundy noted, may also have been a personal hobby—the careful cataloging of “organic souvenirs,” neatly labeled and stored, for reasons that remain both clinical and sentimental.</p>

        <p>Witnesses recall small coolers exiting a side door after tapings. Paperwork exists, Grundy says, though every page is stamped with a different department’s approval. “History demands receipts,” he intoned, “and sometimes the receipts come in jars.”</p>

        <blockquote class="text-center" style="margin:16px 0;">
          <em>“We don’t ask why the wheel spins; we only applaud that it does.”</em>
          <br>— Grundy
        </blockquote>

        <p>Officials insist the campaign reduced stray populations; critics insist the explanation is stranger than the result. Grundy refuses to adjudicate motive. He simply arranges the facts, taps the jar, and lets the echo travel.</p>

        <h3>What OTI Can Confirm</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>A private collection exists and has been inventoried more than once.</li>
          <li>The host’s public service announcements coincide with the years of peak cataloging.</li>
          <li>All labels bear the same reassuring smiley watermark—provenance unclear.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Grundy closes with a request for calm: citizens should continue routine applause while investigators determine whether sentimentality can be considered science when it is so well organized.</p>
